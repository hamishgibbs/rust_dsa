# rust_dsa

Implementation of a few Data Structures & Algorithms in Rust.

Most are a re-implementation of objects by [The Algorithms](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Rust).

Code is annotated with comments for clarity.

### Existing implementations

This library currently implements the following:

**Data Structures:**

Directed & Undirected Graph data structures - [`graph.rs`]().  

**Algorithms:**

Bubble sort: - [`bubble_sort.rs`]().  
Cocktail Shaker sort - [`cocktail_shaker_sort.rs`]().  

**Other:**

Comparison of inherent & trait implementations - [`impl.rs`]().
