# rust_dsa

Implementation of a few Data Structures & Algorithms in Rust.

Most are a re-implementation of objects by [The Algorithms](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Rust).

Code is annotated with comments for clarity.

## Index

This library currently implements the following:

**Data Structures:**

* Directed & Undirected Graph data structures: [`graph.rs`](https://github.com/hamishgibbs/rust_dsa/blob/main/src/bin/graph.rs).  

**Algorithms:**

* Bubble sort: [`bubble_sort.rs`](https://github.com/hamishgibbs/rust_dsa/blob/main/src/bin/bubble_sort.rs).  
* Cocktail Shaker sort [`cocktail_shaker_sort.rs`](https://github.com/hamishgibbs/rust_dsa/blob/main/src/bin/cocktail_shaker_sort.rs).  

**Other:**

* Comparison of inherent & trait implementations: [`impl.rs`](https://github.com/hamishgibbs/rust_dsa/blob/main/src/bin/impl.rs).  

## Usage

Test all files in [`src/bin`](https://github.com/hamishgibbs/rust_dsa/tree/main/src/bin) with:

```{shell}
cargo test
```
